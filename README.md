# AI Finance Dashboard 📈

An interactive Python tool for analyzing stock prices and generating AI-powered forecasts. Built from scratch in November 2025 as my first AI project — from zero coding experience to live predictions in 2 weeks.

## What It Does
- Pulls **real-time stock data** from Yahoo Finance (e.g., NVDA, AAPL)
- Plots **30-day price trends** with Matplotlib
- Trains a **linear regression model** (scikit-learn) to predict next 7 days
- Interactive: Type any ticker → instant chart + forecast

## Demo
[Live Colab Version](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PxjFgAmFOjNHz6sg75BKQtJ3eFHbo5zX)  
**Latest Output**: AI predicts NVDA at $198.45 in 7 days (from $195.21).

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3** + yfinance (data) + matplotlib (charts) + scikit-learn (AI)
- Google Colab (no install needed)

## Setup (Run Locally)
1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/ai-finance-dashboard.git`
2. Install: `pip install yfinance matplotlib scikit-learn`
3. Run: `python dashboard.py` (add code file next)

## Roadmap
- Week 3: Deploy as live web app (Streamlit)
- Week 4: Add news sentiment analysis (NLP)
